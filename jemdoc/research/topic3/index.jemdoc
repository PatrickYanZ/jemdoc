= Multi-UAVs Path Planning and Aerial Communication

Develops a Branching Dueling deep reinforcement learning solution to simultaneously optimize the multi-UAV cell-association decisions and their moving speed decisions on a given 3D aerial highway.

The following are a few problems that we are interested to address:

- Multi UAVs collisions
- Connectivity
- Handoffs
