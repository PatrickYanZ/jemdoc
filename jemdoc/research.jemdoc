A Novel simulation testbed that emulates multi-band wireless network-enabled VNet RF-THz-Highway-Env based on [https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/HighwayEnv HighwayEnv]. This test environment not only inherits the advantages of autonomous driving, and lane changes on the highway, but also implements RF/THz channel propagation modeling, network selection, and HO control.  \n\n

Simultaneously optimize the multi-UAV cell-association decisions and their moving speed decisions on a given 3D aerial highway. The objective is to improve both the transportation and communication performances, e.g., collisions, connectivity, and HOs.  \n\n

We explore the integration of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and Condition Value at Risk (CVaR) to optimize the kinematics and network connectivity of autonomous vehicles (AVs) under stochastic conditions, such as wireless channels and traffic dynamics.  \n\n
